What is PyNE?
==============================
PyNE is a free & open source nuclear engineering toolkit.

.. break

It aims to be **fast** and **usable**.

What is PyNE's Goal?
==============================
As a toolkit, PyNE is the substrate on which 
nuclear science and engineering problems are solved.  

.. break

The goal is to be **useful**.  Therefore new development takes an engineering 
approach with three main thrusts:

.. break

    * Data structures

.. break

    * Algorithms

.. break

    * Data 


What is PyNE's Purpose?
==============================
As a free & open project, we want people (grad students) to stop 
*constantly* reinventing the wheel. |no-wheel|

.. break

The wheel that we do invent will be natural, fast, tested, documented, and 
reproducible.

.. break

This will allow *everyone* to shorten development time by more 
quickly being able to spin up new students, test new ideas, contribute 
back, and publish.

.. break

This means less overhead for maintanence and bug fixes.
